#' @title r3PG â€“ an R package for forest growth simulation using 3-PG process-based model
#' @docType package
#' @description The r3PG serves as a flexible and easy-to-use interface for the 3-PGpjs and the 3-PGmix model written in Fortran.The package, allows for fast and easy interaction with the model, and Fortran re-implementation facilitates computationally intensive sensitivity analysis and calibration. The user can flexibly switch between various options and submodules, to use the original 3-PGpjs model version for monospecific, even-aged and evergreen forests and the 3-PGmix model, which can also simulate multi-cohort stands (e.g. mixtures, uneven-aged) that contain deciduous species.
